;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements a successor to esh-interval-trees.el.  Roughly, the
;; history of ESH solutions to conflicting ranges is as follows (two ranges
;; conflict if they overlap and none of them is a subset of the other):
;;
;; * The very first releast did not construct a document tree: instead, it
;;   segmented text into ranges with consistent text properties, and rendered
;;   each range separately.  In this approach, there's no nesting: just a flat
;;   sequence of annotated segments.  This is very simple to implement, but it
;;   breaks e.g. boxes: that is, it renders <box>a<bold>b</bold></box> as
;;   <box>a</box<box+bold>b</box+bold>.  Unfortunately, that doesn't look right
;;   at all (it has two boxes instead of one).
;;
;; * The second release tried to tackle this by detecting conflicts using a
;;   doubly-linked list of <begin …> and <end …> events as a stack, and
;;   recording all conflicts by scanning from each <close> tag back to the
;;   corresponding <begin> tag.  Conflicts were then resolved one by one,
;;   according to a user-provided priority order.  Unfortunately, this approach
;;   ran into issues with conflicting intervals that started or ended at the
;;   same point.  The argument for its correctness wasn't very clear, either.
;;
;; * The third release introduced document trees (binary trees whose nodes
;;   contained annotations (property-value pairs) and whose leaves were text
;;   ranges).  Document trees were furthermore extended to include the leftmost
;;   and rightmost point covered by each node, allowing for easy splitting.
;;
;;   The algorithm proceeded by inserting each interval into the tree, starting
;;   with low-priority ones.  Most intervals would fit in the tree (either
;;   because they exactly subsumed an existing subtree, or because they were
;;   subsets of an existing interval with no conflicting children), but when an
;;   interval didn't fit the tree could be split into three parts, and the
;;   annotation of the newly added interval was applied to the middle part.
;;   Unfortunately, this still created spurious splits: a pathological case is
;;   described below:
;;
;;     > Suppose there's one interval a:5-15. Insert b:1-10, which splits a into
;;     > a1:5-10 and a2:10-15.  Then insert c:1-8, which splits a1 into a11:5-8
;;     > and a12:8-10, and b into b1:1-8 and b2:8-10.  But now b2 fits into a12,
;;     > and a11 fits in b1.  The trick is that inserting b1 and b2 into a1':5-8
;;     > a2':8-15 would not have required further splits.  In other words,
;;     > cutting a to accommodate b wasn't right, since b was going to be cut
;;     > later on, rendering the original cut useless.
;;
;; * This file (the 4th release) works somewhat differently.  At first, all
;;   intervals are collected in one large interval tree (implemented using an
;;   augmented binary tree).  This augmented tree is paired with an alternate
;;   representation of the same intervals — namely, a bag of intervals indexed
;;   by priority and starting position (note that there is at most one interval
;;   of each priority at each position).
;;
;;   In addition to insertion, the interval tree supports a “split” operation.
;;   Given an interval I, “split” finds all lower-priority intervals that
;;   conflict with I, and splits them to resolve conflicts.  Splitting can
;;   happen in-place: the left half of each split interval replaces the original
;;   interval, and the right part is accumulated into a list of new intervals
;;   (interestingly, these new intervals cannot themselves conflict with I —
;;   this is because any interval can have at most one conflict with any other
;;   interval).  The list of new intervals is then added to both the bag and the tree.
;;
;;   The bag's main purpose is to make it easy (and quick) to find all intervals
;;   of a given priority (the bag is implemented with one bucket per priority
;;   level, which is much simpler than maintaining a separate set of intervals
;;   ordered by priority).  This operation is crucial, because the algorithm
;;   proceeds by iterating over each priority bucket, and splitting the tree
;;   along each interval, in decreasing order of priority.  When this operation
;;   completes, the tree contains a set of properly nesting intervals, with no
;;   conflicts left.
;;
;;   The last step is to build a document tree from the list of all intervals.
;;   This is done by keeping a stack of intervals, and inserting each interval
;;   into the previous one, unless it doesn't fit in there.  If not, intervals
;;   are repeatedly popped from the stack, until one in which the current
;;   interval fits is found (intervals with no annotations are added as
;;   appropriate to ensure that all text ranges are covered by at least one
;;   children-less interval.  This process relies crucially on the order in
;;   which intervals are inserted, and since this order (start point, length,
;;   -priority) is a refinement of the order needed in the interval tree there
;;   is in fact no need for re-sorting (the tree itself is sorted according to
;;   that order).
