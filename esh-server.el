;;; Commentary:

;; This package contains functions than run on the server that esh-client

This function is appropriate as a value for `debugger' (hence
ARGS).  We need this function because the server doesn't print
backtraces; thus we take a more aggressive stand and simply
intercept all errors as they happen.  We just store the backtrace
in esh--server-backtrace and rethrow the error immediately; then
the `condition-case' in `esh-server-eval' will catch the error,
unless it's nicely handled somewhere else."
